#### Homework
  + SWIRL Basic R Programming section 9, 10, 12, 14, 15
  + find a dataset in the fivethirtyeight package and create linear models to explain variables
  and answer interesting questions.
  + create a plot showing predicted vs actual with a re line of slope 1, intercept 0 to demonstrate model performance.
  + create a density plot of the residuals of the model to show that they are normally distributed
 + upload a single doc with the code and graphics to oaks.
